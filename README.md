- Randomized bosses
- Randomized starting parties (currently not previewable)
- Randomized shops and item prices
- Randomized learned moves
- Randomized digivolutions
- Randomized starting stats and affinities
- Randomized map coloration

## Binary Download

[Releases](https://github.com/markisha64/dmw3-randomizer/releases) for Windows/Ubuntu, built by github CI

## Requirements

- libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev (Linux only)
- ~700MB of extra storage (for rom extracted files)

## Building from source

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
   You also need to have [mkpsxiso](https://github.com/Lameguy64/mkpsxiso) installed or have the necessary tools to build it

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/markisha64/dmw3-randomizer.git
   ```
3. **Build mkpsxiso(skip if installed)**: Navigate to the repository directory and built the randomizer using cmake:
   ```shell
   cmake --preset ci -S ./mkpsxiso -B ./mkpsxiso/build
   cmake --build ./mkpsxiso/build --config Release
   ```

4. **Build the Randomizer**: Navigate to the repository directory and build the randomizer using Cargo:
   ```shell
   cd dmw3-randomizer
   cargo build --release
   ```

5. **Usage**: Run the randomizer:
   ```shell
   cargo run --release
   ```
   Or if you want to use it as cli tool
   ```shell
   cargo run --release -- [options]
   ```
   Replace `[options]` with the specific options you want to use for randomization.


6. **Play the Randomized ROM**: Once the randomization process is complete, you'll find the randomized ROM file in the designated output folder. Load the ROM in your favorite Digimon World 3 emulator to start your randomized adventure!
