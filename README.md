# Digimon World 3 Randomizer

The Digimon World 3 Randomizer is a tool developed in Rust that allows players to experience Digimon World 3 in a whole new way by randomizing various game elements.(currently encounters only) This repository contains the source code for the randomizer along with instructions on how to use it.

## Features

- Randomize wild Digimon encounters throughout the game.
- Generate a randomized ROM file ready to be played on your favorite emulator.
